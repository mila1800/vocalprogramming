## Vocal Programming ##

In order to measure the efficiency of vocal programming in the respective paradigms (oop and reactive), 
we will use predefined code-snippets performing common tasks (such as reading files, iterating over a list) 
and record ourselves as we generate these code-snippets using a vocal programming tool.
We will study the recording, and note down the number of utterances, length of utterances,
and number of words used. This data will then be used to produce a spreadsheet in order 
to give a representation of the comparative efficiency. Because the code-snippets will likely
contain a varied number of characters and lines, this will be taken into consideration as well.
